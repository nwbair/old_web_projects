This is an example of a STAR ticket for new customer calls. You will receive an email each morning with a list of new customers.  After receiving your assignment of the account numbers you are responsible for contacting, create a new STAR ticket for each. Look up the contact information in STAR, and check to see if they have previously contacted technical support about installing or program issues. If they appear to have the program installed and are actively using it, no call will be needed. Close the STAR ticket noting that the customer is already using the program. 
</p>
 <p>
Make sure to document every time you call the customer.  If you have made three attempts over three different days and have not been able to reach the customer, close your ticket, but make sure you have left a message with the customer on how to contact us.
 </p>
 <ul>
     <li>If you receive a College, University, or CCH Internal account there is no need to call these clients.  </li>
 </ul>
